### Problem Statement
At this time of the pandemic, all the offices are closed because of Coronavirus.As the pandemic slowly settles and such sectors become eager to resume in-person work, individuals are still skeptical of getting back to the office.Despite the vaccine, the second wave of the virus has came and affect almost all countries imposed lockdown. So in such circumstances, temperature checking and use of contact less hand opners is an effective way to tackle the deadly corona virus.Multiple studies have shown that the use of touchless opener & temperature checking reduces the risk of viral transmission as well as provides a sense of protection. However, it is infeasible to manually enforce such a policy on large premises and track any violations.Covid-19-Human-Detection-Systems provides a better alternative. Using a combination of micro-controller, motor and sensor we developed a robust system that can help people hundred percent contact free.
### Proposed Solution
Many Organizations are making it compulsory to follow social distancing and temperature detection.This project cost-effective Arduino-based system aiming to help organizations respect the COVID-19 safety rules and guidelines in order to reduce the disease spread is presented. 
It can be quite helpful to the offices at this time as it can be installed outside the office and will help to sense the temperature of every person who is coming to the office and by allowing automatic entry to right person.
