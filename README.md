# covid-homo-detect
Aim was to build a product that can be helpful for common people in daily day to day life and to limit Corona virus spread. So we planned to develop an affordable Arduino-based solution to increase COVID-19 indoor safety, covering several relevant aspects: 1)Automatic sense human, 2) Touchless hands-free door opener, 3) Automatically Contactless temperature sensing.
